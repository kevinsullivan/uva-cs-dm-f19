# This Directory

This directory contains four files other than this one.

The prop_logic.lean file contains  our implementation of
the syntax and semantics of propositional logic. You must
understand everything in this file to be able to do this
homework productively. It's material we have spent some
days on in class. Review it with care as needed.

The bool_sat.lean file contains a slightly improved
version of our satisfiability solver (which we also
characterize as a model finder; see the comments in
the file). We covered the implementation in class but
you will almost certainly need to study the code with
great care to fully understand how it works. A key
goal of this assignment is to check that you have
come to understand in detail and in precise detail
how the SAT solver works.

The file bool_sat_playground.lean is a file within
which you can do whatever small experiments you want
to explore and better understand what the functions
in bool_sat.lean do and how to use them. Use it as
you wish, or not. You will turn it in and we might
have a look but it won't count toward your grade.

Last, hw7_sat.lean contains your assignment.
Open it, follow the instructions, and when you're
finished, you will submit this file and, if you
wish, your "playground" file as well. We will
grade your hw7_sat.lean file.

You should not need to and probably should not
change either the prop_logic or bool_sat Lean
files.
